Machine Learning Automation of Lending Decisions/Credit Scoring

    Automating lending decision-making using machine learning is revolutionizing the finance and lending industry by leveraging advanced algorithms to streamline and enhance the approval process.

    Traditionally, loan approvals involved labor-intensive manual reviews and subjective judgments which not only leads to inefficiencies and potential biases but also can be time consuming.

    Machine learning lending decision automation hold high promise in speeding up the approval process, reducing the time from application to decision, improving operational efficiency and reducing on labor-related costs.

    Automated systems enables real-time processing of loan applications, can handle large volumes of applications simultaneously and hence scaling operations without the need for proportional increases in resources.

    This work focus on evaluating the extend at which leveraging the three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost and LGBM in loan application decision making can reduce the cost of loan processing
